            "question": "What is a monopoly?",
            "answer": "A monopoly is a market structure in which a single seller supplies a good or service with no close substitutes and where entry by competitors is impeded. Monopolists typically set prices rather than take them, and monopolies affect market efficiency, consumer welfare and innovation. Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"
          },
          {
            "question": "What are the major types of monopolies?",
            "answer": "Common classifications include pure (single seller), natural (most efficient single provider due to high fixed costs), legal/statutory (created by law, e.g. patents or franchises), geographic (exclusive regional control), technological (exclusive control of a technology), and government/public monopolies (state as sole provider). Related structures include oligopoly and monopolistic competition. Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"
          },
          {
            "question": "What causes monopolies to form?",
            "answer": "Typical causes are economies of scale (cost advantages for a large incumbent), control of key resources or infrastructure, legal/regulatory barriers (patents, licenses), strong network effects (value rising with users), and strategic exclusion (predatory pricing or other deterrents). Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"
          },
          {
            "question": "What are the economic effects of monopolies?",
            "answer": "Monopolies often produce higher prices and reduced output, create deadweight loss (welfare loss), and can reduce competitive pressure to innovate. However, in natural monopoly cases a single provider may be most cost-efficient and regulation can be used to protect users. Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"

          {
            "question": "What is a natural monopoly and when is it acceptable?",
            "answer": "A natural monopoly occurs when one firm can serve the entire market more efficiently than multiple firms due to very high fixed costs and strong economies of scale (typical in utilities like water or electricity). Such cases are often regulated or publicly provided to prevent abuse while preserving efficiency. Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"

          },
          {
            "question": "Why does classifying types of monopolies matter?",
            "answer": "Different monopoly types have distinct causes and policy implications: natural monopolies may need regulation for universal service, legal monopolies (patents) involve trade-offs between innovation incentives and access, and technological or geographic monopolies require competition or antitrust remedies. Classification guides appropriate interventions. Learn more: https://science-dao.org/classification/"

            "question": "What is AIIS (AI Internet‑Socialism)?",
            "answer": "AIIS is an economic and funding model proposed by World Science DAO that uses DAOs, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and algorithmic decision‑making to distribute funds for science and software fairly, reward dependencies (like libraries and prior results), reduce gatekeeping, and provide continuous, transparent recognition and funding. See https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/ for details."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AIIS differ from traditional prizes and grants?",
            "answer": "Unlike traditional grants (fixed cycles, panels, proposals) and prizes (retrospective, small number of winners), AIIS automates allocation based on measurable contributions and dependency metrics, provides continuous flows of support, and combines retrospective recognition with forward‑looking funding. More information: https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AIIS automate prize and grant decisions?",
            "answer": "AIIS uses objective or semi‑objective thresholds (e.g., citations, usage, dependency graphs) together with algorithmic rules or DAO voting to trigger rewards. Donations are distributed proportionally according to computed impact/value metrics rather than being decided by opaque panels. See https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/."
          },
          {
            "question": "What does it mean to reward 'dependencies' in AIIS?",
            "answer": "Rewarding dependencies means allocating funds not only to final results but also to the software libraries, datasets, methods, and earlier work that many later projects build upon. This incentivizes foundational work that is often underfunded. Read more at https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/."
          },
          {
            "question": "What technical components are needed to implement AIIS?",

The project overview is at https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does AIIS prevent gaming, fake citations, or manipulation?",
            "answer": "The post acknowledges manipulation risks and suggests designing robust, dependency‑aware metrics, identity verification, and data‑validation mechanisms. Practical deployment would need anti‑gaming heuristics, reputation systems, and continuous monitoring. See https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/ for the discussion of challenges."

          },
          {
            "question": "How are donations distributed under AIIS?",
            "answer": "The model describes collecting donations (crypto tokens) and distributing them proportionally based on computed shares of impact or world‑GDP‑equivalent value as determined from connected accounts and metrics—yielding immediate or regular support flows rather than single awards. Details: https://science-dao.org/scientific-prize/."

            "question": "What is meant by \"social inclusion\" in the context of science?",
            "answer": "Social inclusion in science means ensuring all people who contribute ideas or discoveries—regardless of race, gender, institutional affiliation, or formal degree—have access to recognition, resources, and funding. The article explains how exclusion (especially by credential) harms scientific progress. Read more: https://science-dao.org/social-inclusion/"

            "question": "How can science degrees act as a \"discrimination amplifier\"?",
            "answer": "Degrees (Bachelor, Master, PhD) create a hierarchy that often excludes talented people who lack formal credentials. When systems privilege degree-holders for funding, publication, or employment, important contributors without degrees can be ignored, slowing or blocking discoveries.

            "question": "What roles do selfishness and tradition play in scientific monopolies?",
            "answer": "Selfishness: researchers and intermediaries often don't want to publish others' work for free. Tradition: many journals and publishers accept submissions only from the original author(s).

            "question": "If a work is released under a permissive license (e.g., Creative Commons), why is it still blocked?",
            "answer": "Even with permissive licensing, traditional practices and publisher policies typically require submissions from the original author, and many people or organizations are reluctant to publish or market others' work for free. Thus licensing alone doesn't overcome cultural and institutional barriers. See: https://science-dao.org/how-does-economy-of-monopolies-work-in-science/"
